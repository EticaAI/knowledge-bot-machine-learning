# Etica.AI Machine Learning Knowledge Bot
Future knowledge bot, machine learning domain. Objective: return semi-randomly
references of how to learn about the subject.

First it will be necessary to gather the respective reference dictionary
(free books, videos, online courses) in a machine-readable format, which is
different from the [format used by humans](#data-sources).

The knowledge bot code [may not stay in this same
repository](https://github.com/EticaAI/knowledge-bot-machine-learning/issues/2)
but the databases, will stay here.

## Databases

For machine-readable format, see [database folder](database/).

## Data sources
