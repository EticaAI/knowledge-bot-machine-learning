# Etica.AI Machine Learning Knowledge Bot: Databases

- Repository [free-book.tsv](free-book.tsv) ([Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WnT6AO4j06M3i8MULW5i7KB2tz5yhNm5fodhehgjPUY/edit?usp=sharing))

## Google Sheets

As explained at [Use Google Sheets to manage data and enable help from
non-programmers](https://github.com/EticaAI/knowledge-bot-machine-learning/issues/1)
is possible to suggest edits at some Google Sheets links, that later can be
exported and merged here.

This is a small project, so we do not care yet with trolls.

### To export a .tsv file
